    "\"A Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dickens depicts the story of Mr. Lorry, Defarge, Miss Darnay and Pross. Following these characters, the novel explores the passage of time in France and England. Family is a recurrent theme, and ideas such as brotherhood and fatherhood are explored through Mr. Lorry's relationships with other characters. Ultimately, this is a love story, even if the characters tend to find themselves threatened by darkness, imprisonment, and death. Dickens does a good job at using symbols such as wine, the streets, bureaucracy and wealth in order to better convey the story. A criticism that can be done is there is little thematic variation across the chapters. Hence, while the plot progresses, the ideas that Dickens explores remain fairly constant, which allows for consistency but ultimately prevents individual chapters from being memorable.\" \n",

    "I actually read the book a couple years ago in literature class in high school. My teacher would definetly not be impressed with this \"review\". Something unsettling is that, just by looking at the topics extracted from our method, we would have no clue about the importance of the French revolution in the novel. We wouldn't even know for sure which are the two cities from the title! (Although we know things happen in France and England, so Paris and London would have been the clear bet). Anyway, this is not that bad for such a naive method."
